# Hangman Game

This is a simple console-based Hangman game implemented in Java. The game allows users to choose between
Russian and English vocabulary for guessing words. The game logic, vocabulary handling, and Hangman drawing are
encapsulated in different classes to maintain a clean and modular design.

## Usage

1. When you run the game, you will be prompted to select a vocabulary language.
2. After selecting the vocabulary language, the game will start immediately, and you will be prompted to guess letters to reveal the hidden word.
3. The game will display the Hangman drawing and the number of mistakes.
4. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
5. After the game ends you will be prompted to start a new game, change the vocabulary language, or exit:
   - Enter "Y" to start a new game.
   - Enter "L" to change the vocabulary language.
   - Enter "N" to exit the game.
