# Hangman Game

This is a simple console-based Hangman game implemented in Java. The game allows users to choose between
Russian and English vocabulary for guessing words. The game logic, vocabulary handling and Hangman drawing are 
encapsulated in different classes to maintain a clean and modular design.

## Usage

1. When you run the game, you will be prompted to start a new game or exit.
2. Enter "N" to start a new game or "X" to exit.
3. If you start a new game, you will be prompted to guess letters to reveal the hidden word.
4. The game will display the Hangman drawing and the number of attempts left.
5. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
